# The simplest way to control the flow of your code using conditionals is with the if statement.
# The general syntax of an if statement is shown here:

if statement_to_be_evaluated == true
    # do something awesome...
end

if 1 < 2
    puts "Hot diggity, 1 is less than 2!"
end
#=> Hot diggity, 1 is less than 2!

# If there is only one line of code to be evaluated inside the block,
# then you can rewrite the code to be more succinct and take up only one line:

puts "Hot diggity damn, 1 is less than 2" if 1 < 2
# You donâ€™t even need the end statement. Nice and concise!

# Adding else and elsif

if attack_by_land == true
    puts "release the goat"
else
    puts "release the shark"
end

if attack_by_land == true
    puts "release the goat"
elsif attack_by_sea == true
    puts "release the shark"
else
    puts "release Kevin the octopus"
end
